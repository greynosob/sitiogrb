      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hymnals are books with collections of musical hymns that can typically be found in churches. Prayerbooks or missals are books that contain written prayers and are commonly carried by monks, nuns, and other devoted followers or clergy. Lap books are a learning tool created by students.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are several other types of books which are not commonly found under this system. Albums are books for holding a group of items belonging to a particular theme, such as a set of photographs, card collections, and memorabilia. One common example is stamp albums, which are used by many hobbyists to protect and organize their collections of postage stamps. Such albums are often made using removable plastic pages held inside in a ringed binder or other similar holder. Picture books are books for children with pictures on every page and less text (or even no text).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hardcover books have a stiff binding. Paperback books have cheaper, flexible covers which tend to be less durable. An alternative to paperback is the glossy cover, otherwise known as a dust cover, found on magazines, and comic books. Spiral-bound books are bound by spirals made of metal or plastic. Examples of spiral-bound books include teachers&amp;rsquo; manuals and puzzle books (crosswords, sudoku).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;gallery-box&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;div class=&#34;gallery&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://via.placeholder.com/1200x800&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;Project&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://via.placeholder.com/1200x800&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;Project&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;  &lt;em&gt;Photo by &lt;a href=&#34;https://via.placeholder.com/1200x800&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Freepik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are several other types of books which are not commonly found under this system.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A paragraph looks like this — Globally incubate standards compliant channels before scalable benefits. Quickly disseminate superior deliverables whereas web-enabled applications. Quickly drive clicks-and-mortar catalysts for change before vertical architectures. Credibly reintermediate backend ideas for cross-platform models. Continually reintermediate integrated processes through technically sound intellectual capital. Holistically foster superior methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;headings-by-default&#34;&gt;Headings by default:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;h1-default-styles-for-headings&#34;&gt;H1 Default styles for headings&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;h2-default-styles-for-headings&#34;&gt;H2 Default styles for headings&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;h3-default-styles-for-headings&#34;&gt;H3 Default styles for headings&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;h4-default-styles-for-headings&#34;&gt;H4 Default styles for headings&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;h5 id=&#34;h5-default-styles-for-headings&#34;&gt;H5 Default styles for headings&lt;/h5&gt;&#xA;&lt;h6 id=&#34;h6-default-styles-for-headings&#34;&gt;H6 Default styles for headings&lt;/h6&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;lists&#34;&gt;Lists&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;ordered-list-example&#34;&gt;Ordered list example:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Poutine drinking vinegar bitters.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Coloring book distillery fanny pack.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Venmo biodiesel gentrify enamel pin meditation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Jean shorts shaman listicle pickled portland.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Salvia mumblecore brunch iPhone migas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;unordered-list-example&#34;&gt;Unordered list example:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bitters semiotics vice thundercats synth.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Literally cred narwhal bitters wayfarers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Kale chips chartreuse paleo tbh street art marfa.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mlkshk polaroid sriracha brooklyn.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pug you probably haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of them air plant man bun.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;table&#34;&gt;Table&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;table-container&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;table&gt;&#xA;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Header 1&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Header 2&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Header 3&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Header 4&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Header 5&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:1 Cell:1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:1 Cell:2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:1 Cell:3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:1 Cell:4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:1 Cell:5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:2 Cell:1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:2 Cell:2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:2 Cell:3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:2 Cell:4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:2 Cell:5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:3 Cell:1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:3 Cell:2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:3 Cell:3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:3 Cell:4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:3 Cell:5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:4 Cell:1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:4 Cell:2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:4 Cell:3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:4 Cell:4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:4 Cell:5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:5 Cell:1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:5 Cell:2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:5 Cell:3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:5 Cell:4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:5 Cell:5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:6 Cell:1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:6 Cell:2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:6 Cell:3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:6 Cell:4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:6 Cell:5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/table&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;quotes&#34;&gt;Quotes&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-quote-looks-like-this&#34;&gt;A quote looks like this:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The longer I live, the more I realize that I am never wrong about anything, and that all the pains I have so humbly taken to verify my notions have only wasted my time!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
