      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hardcover books have a stiff binding. Paperback books have cheaper, flexible covers which tend to be less durable. An alternative to paperback is the glossy cover, otherwise known as a dust cover, found on magazines, and comic books. Spiral-bound books are bound by spirals made of metal or plastic. Examples of spiral-bound books include teachers&amp;rsquo; manuals and puzzle books (crosswords, sudoku).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;gallery-box&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;div class=&#34;gallery&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://via.placeholder.com/1200x800&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;Project&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://via.placeholder.com/1200x800&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;Project&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;  &lt;em&gt;Photo by &lt;a href=&#34;https://via.placeholder.com/1200x800&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Freepik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are several other types of books which are not commonly found under this system. Albums are books for holding a group of items belonging to a particular theme, such as a set of photographs, card collections, and memorabilia. One common example is stamp albums, which are used by many hobbyists to protect and organize their collections of postage stamps. Such albums are often made using removable plastic pages held inside in a ringed binder or other similar holder. Picture books are books for children with pictures on every page and less text (or even no text).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
