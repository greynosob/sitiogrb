# How to Build a Professional Website in 5 Days 🚀

This is how my site looks: [https://greynosob.github.io/sitiogrb/](https://greynosob.github.io/sitiogrb/)

---

In many job applications, they ask to include a link to your personal website. Because of this, I decided to embark on a journey to create a site where I could showcase my professional background and skills. 💼

---

### Day 1: Choosing the Right Tool and Template 🧭

At first, I tried using WordPress, but it was so frustrating and complicated 😤 that I sought advice and was introduced to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). 

> Hugo is a static site generator that allows you to focus on creating content in Markdown, and it automatically updates menus and site navigation.

On day one, I navigated through the sea of templates and their configurations, deciding which one would best suit my style and offer the easiest maintenance.

### Day 2: Creating Illustrations 🎨

Eventually, I found a template that fit my needs, and I realized it was necessary to have illustrations. So, on day two, I dedicated myself to creating illustrations.

* I first tried Microsoft's AI, but besides limited free attempts, the results weren't my style.
* Then I searched “AI image generator” and discovered [Canva](https://www.canva.com/es_mx/generador-imagenes-ia/).
* This tool, besides not having limits on the number of images you can generate, produced results much closer to my style.

And so, day two passed.

### Day 3: Organizing Content and Using AI Assistance 🤖

Next was organizing the content. It was crucial to properly populate the parameters, make it visually appealing, and display items chronologically.

For this, I used [TypingMind](https://www.typingmind.com/), which uses ChatGPT.  
There I was, extracting information from my CV.

For the publications section, it felt too much to add images for each one, so I focused on adding parameters and understanding their application on the pages so images could be optional. This took up day three.

---

### Day 4: Publishing on GitHub Pages 🌐

Finally, it was time to publish the website. I was already told this could be done through [GitHub](https://github.com/), so I asked ChatGPT for the steps.

To my surprise:  
* Images didn’t display  
* Some links didn’t work properly

It turned out GitHub pages URLs follow the structure:  
`https://username.github.io/my-project/`  

> You need to make sure the templates use relative paths correctly.

Day four was all about adapting the site to its production hosting. Luckily, I backed up my images because I ran a command that rebuilt the site from scratch and during this, it erased my images and left the placeholder ones from the template.

### Advice for Building Your Own Website 💡

If I had to advise someone creating their website, I would recommend:

1. Having a polished CV and LinkedIn profile ready first.
2. Making the first version of the site in English. 🇺🇸
