# 🤖 *"AI made the hard work in 2 hours : My Experience with AI and Cloud"* 💻🤯

Since AI literacy is becoming essential, I decided to launch a project to dive into the world of small business. 💡 I’ve never been one to hoard things; in fact, I enjoy decluttering and organizing my space regularly. From time to time, I find valuable items I no longer need and think: "I should sell these to recover some of my investment."

This thought sparked the need to create a website with zero membership fees and minimal maintenance. 🛠️

🤖 Discovering Cloud Code

While researching, I came across Cloud Code. This AI resides locally on your computer and, when given a sufficiently detailed prompt, is capable of generating a full development plan and offering strategic suggestions.

Together, we concluded that the inventory management should be handled via Google Sheets 📊. This allows me to maintain total control over the data without being dependent on the codebase. By using the "Plan Mode," the AI begins its development workflow, asking for modifications or permissions as it progresses.

In just one hour, I had a functional site with automated deployment to GitHub 🐙. Right as I finished, my Cloud Code usage window closed.

🛡️ Security and Quality Assurance

Later, I revisited the tool with a specific security prompt to review the application and fix any vulnerabilities. It handled the modifications smoothly, and in the process, I learned how to manage environment variables in both GitHub and Google Cloud Console. 🔐

I also asked the AI to act as a QA (Quality Assurance) engineer to refine the site further. A key move was asking it to include all setup instructions in the README file, ensuring I wasn't dependent on the AI to understand how to re-deploy the site in the future. 📝

🧱 Overcoming Roadblocks

I encountered some issues during the GitHub deployment just as my time window expired again. At that point, I turned to my "old friend" ChatGPT 🧠. It quickly identified the missing pieces in my config.js for a successful deployment.

And just like that! After approximately 4 hours of work, the project was live. While I feel I might have relied a bit too much on these tools, the end result is exactly what I asked for. ✅

🏁 Final Thoughts

I highly recommend using Cloud Code, provided you invest enough time in crafting a robust initial prompt. If you don't have a clear starting point, it's better to begin with a conversational AI to refine your idea first. 🗣️

It has been an incredible experience. The future is approaching at a dizzying pace, and it won't wait for those who stay behind. The time to adapt is now. ⏱️✨
