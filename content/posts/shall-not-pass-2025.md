# 🧙‍♂️✨ *"You Shall Not Pass 'Professional Data Engineer'"* 🧙‍♀️✨

This year, I embarked on an exciting adventure learning new technologies for **massive data management** in **serverless environments**, utilizing Google's powerful tools like **BigQuery**, **Dataproc**, and **Dataflow**, among others.

Over the course of **7 weeks**, I received comprehensive training and participated in hands-on labs that fully immersed me in these cutting-edge technologies.

I enjoyed every part of the process — from discovering solutions for data challenges completely different from my past experiences, to learning new and complex concepts. I dedicated entire afternoons to:

- Watching training videos 🎥  
- Completing labs 🧪  
- Taking notes 📝  
- Reviewing material intensively 🔍  

There were moments when I truly felt my brain was about to explode! 💥

Yesterday, I took the required exam, which needed to be completed by early June according to the sponsor. Though I knew I wasn’t fully prepared and expected not to pass, the experience left me **delighted** and **highly motivated** to continue exploring this vast ocean of new knowledge 🌊.

Huge thanks to Google's **Get Certified** program for this incredible opportunity! 🌟
