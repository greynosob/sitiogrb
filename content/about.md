My expertise includes:

- .NET, Java, and SQL Server
- Cloud technologies like AWS
- A little front end with vue, node.js and javascript
- Version control tools such as GitHub, working effectively in teams

I have been working remotely for nearly 4 years, interacting in English with international teams.

I have learned to leverage artificial intelligence to optimize my work and bridge gaps in front-end technologies like TypeScript and JavaScript.

I possess extensive experience with agile methodologies and a deep understanding of the software development lifecycle.

I stay up-to-date through continuous learning, committed to excellence, and always seeking to make significant improvements in every project.
